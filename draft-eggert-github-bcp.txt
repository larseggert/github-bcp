   [blame Carsten Bormann for this subsection]

   The CoRE WG (Constrained RESTful Environments) has been actively
   using the Trac/SVN combination offered by the Tools Team for its
   older drafts.  Some newer drafts (including some drafts that are not
   yet WG drafts but could be considered candidates for that) are now
   being worked on in the "core-wg" github organization.  These drafts
   generally use Martin Thomson's template, except where the build
   process (examples, grammars) is much more complicated than can easily
   be supported by this template.

   We try to keep discussion on the mailing list (as opposed to getting
   them entirely in the github issues), but may not have been very
   successful in that; it definitely requires constant vigilance.

   The WG Wiki [1] says:

      With respect to the mode of operation of the repository, the CoRE
      WG follows the lead of the HTTPBIS WG [add link here].
      Specifically that means that github issues are welcome to record

      editorial issues as well as technical ones; as are "pull requests"
      (forks of the repository with fixes for an issue).  However,
      technical discussion should not happen in the forums implicitly
      created by the issues, but on the WG mailing list.

   We currently do not have an active backup regime.
