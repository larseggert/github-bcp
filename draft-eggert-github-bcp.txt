1.  Introduction

2.  Experiences from Working Groups

2.1.  CORE

   [blame Carsten Bormann for this subsection]

   The CoRE WG (Constrained RESTful Environments) has been actively
   using the Trac/SVN combination offered by the Tools Team for its
   older drafts.  Some newer drafts (including some drafts that are not
   yet WG drafts but could be considered candidates for that) are now
   being worked on in the "core-wg" github organization.  These drafts
   generally use Martin Thomson's template, except where the build
   process (examples, grammars) is much more complicated than can easily
   be supported by this template.

   We try to keep discussion on the mailing list (as opposed to getting
   them entirely in the github issues), but may not have been very
   successful in that; it definitely requires constant vigilance.

   The WG Wiki [1] says:

      With respect to the mode of operation of the repository, the CoRE
      WG follows the lead of the HTTPBIS WG [2].  Specifically that
      means that github issues are welcome to record editorial issues as
      well as technical ones; as are "pull requests" (forks of the
      repository with fixes for an issue).  However, technical
      discussion should not happen in the forums implicitly created by
      the issues, but on the WG mailing list.

   We currently do not have an active backup regime; we would expect the
   IETF to come up with one that we can share.

   As the contributors to CoRE are not necessarily deeply involved in
   software projects that already make use of github, moving work to
   github may create a sudden barrier of entry for some contributors at
   the same time as other contributors report that the work got much
   easier for them.  Also, accidents do happen (such as committing
   versions of a text that suddenly have CRLF line endings), and some
   authors may not know how to fix them.

   (There is a separate, chairs-only github organization for chair
   materials.)

   (Add similar text for 6Lo, T2TRG, LWIG, CBOR, LPWAN...)

2.2.  QUIC

   The QUIC WG [3] was chartered in October 2016, and has been using
   GitHub very intensively.

   We created a GitHub organization called "quicwg" [4], which the WG
   chairs administer.  Under than organization, we set up two teams, one
   for WG document editors [5] and one for regular contributors [6].
   Membership in the former team is contingent on being chosen as an
   editor for a WG deliverable.  The latter team is more open, and
   consists of people that the chairs and editors want to assign reviews
   or issues to.  Obviously, anyone can raise issues, comment on them,
   submit pull requests, etc.  The benefit of the "contributors" team
   really lies in allowing the assignment of tasks to individuals, which
   is otherwise not possible.

   Underneath the "quicwg" organization, we created two repositories,
   one for WG materials [7] and one for our base WG drafts [8].  Only
   the chairs have commit permissions to the WG materials repo, which is
   mostly used to hold presentations and other materials from our
   various meetings.  This repo is configured to not allow issues to be
   raised or have a wiki (we instead store Markdown files inside the
   repo.)

   Our second repo, for "base drafts", is where most of the work occurs.
   The decision to use a common repo for several drafts was deliberate.
   QUIC is a complex protocol with a complex specification, text moves
   between different documents and issues can affect several.
   Maintaining each draft in a separate repo, while "cleaner" on first
   impression, actually complicates this workflow.  When the WG adopts
   additional drafts, we will decide on a case-by-case basis whether
   they will be made part of the "base drafts" or if we create a new
   repo underneath the organization.  Since Martin Thomson is an editor,
   we use his setup I-D template [ID-TEMPLATE] to rapidly publish HTML
   editor copies of the specs.

   The "base drafts" repo is configured to allow issues to be raised,
   and its wiki is enabled (but rarely used.)  Editors (and chairs) have
   commit rights to this repo.

   We use sets of labels to tag issues that are raised.  One set simply
   indicates which draft(s) an issue applies to, or whether it is
   potentially of broad "design" impact, or "editorial" in nature so
   that an editor can use his or her own discretion to resolve it
   without WG consensus.  A second set is used to track the WG consensus
   on each issue (with states that currently include "needs-discussion",
   "confirm-consensus", "notify-consensus" and "editor-ready").  Issues
   progress from "needs-discussion" to either "confirm-consensus" or
   "notify-consensus".  The former is entered when consensus amongst the
   participants in the discussion has emerged, and the WG needs to
   confirm this consensus on the list.  The latter is entered when a
   consensus call happened at a WG meeting, and the mailing list needs
   to confirm this consensus.  (It is not clear if two separate labels
   actually make all that much sense here.)  Once WG consensus has been
   established, an issue is labeled "editor-ready".

   Although the QUIC WG has only been chartered for a few months, we
   have already had ~250 issues raised, many of which have attracted
   dozens of comments.  Good issue topics and actively searching for
   prior issues before opening new ones is essential to manage the
   workflow.

   In order to allow WG participants to follow the activity on GitHub
   without needing to check the GitHub web site, we have set up a
   separate "quic-issues" [9] mailing list at the IETF.  It was a
   deliberate decision to use a list other than the regular WG mailing
   list.  First, because we are intensively using GitHub, a lot of
   notifications get generated (dozens per day), which would drown out
   other list traffic, Second, the issues list is configured as a read-
   only list, where all incoming email is rejected, except for some
   whitelisted senders.  The intent is to keep all discussion on the
   regular WG mailing list, or on GitHub tickets.  (While GitHub will
   correctly reflect email replies to issue notifications, they seem to
   loose sender information, which is useless.)

   Getting GitHub notifications to go to this list was mildly painful,
   and involved creating a dummy "IETF QUIC WG" GitHub user account
   [10], whose subscription email address is the quic-issues list
   address.  The dummy user was made a member of the QUIC GitHub
   organization, and will therefore by default "track" all repo
   activity.  This will cause GitHub to create the desired stream of
   notification emails to an IETF list.  One caveat here is that GitHub
   uses the email address associated with the user who is interacting
   with the web site as the sender address of notification emails, which

   requires regular whitelisting in mailman.  It also means that these
   users are allowed to otherwise email the issues list; we trust they
   don't.  This email integration is rather dissatisfyingly complex;
   we'd be interested to learn of a better way.
